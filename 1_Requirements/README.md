# Selection of Microcontrollers

# Introduction

This ,mini-project, is a console application using the C programming language. This project compiled in VSC code with the GCC compiler. In this console application, you can Choose the controller that is required to perform projects according to inputs given.



# Cost and Features

We always wonder that how controllers are built and why there are multiple type of controllers to perform single task.Thats beacuse each controller has different frequency and different number of input output pins etc..
The Project and the program helps user to get the reuired controller and perform tasks.The program takes input as listed
 
 1. Frequency required
 2. Number of input pins required
 3. Number of outut pins required
 4. Size of RAM required
 5. Number of Analog Pins Required
 



# SWOT ANALYSIS
## STRENGTH
 The code helps us to choose the exact controller with specifications that are neede to perform project.


 ## WEAKNESS
 There are multiple bugs that should be removed to get the program for higher use
 ## OPPORTUNITIES
 This provides great help to choose the controller with specifications needed to complete project
 ## Threats
 The program may show a low_level controller sometime that can lead to the damage of other components 

# 4W's and 1'H

## Who:

The project can be used almost by all the particular organization people.At the end,user satisfaction is the goal of the project.

## What:

It is choosing the controller of our specifications


## When:

The project can be used when ever we decide to buy a controller

## Where:

This is used in many occasions and can be used by school staff,students and other people who like to perform electronic projects.


## How:

This is approach to select the controller that can be used by us in the electronic field
