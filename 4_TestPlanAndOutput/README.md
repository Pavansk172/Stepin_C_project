# TESTPLAN
     The project is designed for selection of microcontrollers that can be used for various projects
1. Checking for opertaions that are not included in programs.
  a) When processor frequency is asked as input to the user, only frequency should be given as input in Mhz manner.
  2. same goes for other inputs like Pins and Ram
2. Checking wether all the operations are performed correctly when given input
3. Chechking all the operations modes are working fine.
4. All the controllers with given specs are processed and then recommeneded to the user
